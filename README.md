* no installation needed, works everywhere where PHP 5.3 and above is installed
  * [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/) tested
* designed as re-usable PHP code library
* configurable with single/multiple INI file(s) and command line options
* efficient compare algorithm
  * works with huge amount of files
  * minimize traffic and CPU
  * use time and md5 for change detection
  * sqlite3 implementation
* backup from Linux/Windows file system
  * support for UTF8 file names
  * support for case-sensitive file names
  * symlink handling
* backup to Amazon S3 storage
  * parallel upload multiple parts of huge files
  * multiple backups into the same bucket
* configurable independent output drivers
  * output to console
  * log into sqlite database
* extendable with PHP code
  * file filters
  * new storage drivers
  * backup preparation processes (DB, subversion, etc.)
  * improved compare algorithm

Installation
------------

* get code from <http://github.com/k2s/xtbackup>
  * git clone git://github.com/k2s/xtbackup.git
  * cd xtbackup
  * git submodule update --init
* copy examples/minimal.ini and examples/s3access.ini to own folder
* modify this files (see Configuration section)
* test environment for Amazon S3 backups (read the output): `php -f xtbackup.php ini[]=/path_to/minimal.ini storage.s3.compatibility-test=true`
* dry run with : `php -f xtbackup.php ini[]=/path_to/s3access.ini ini[]=/path_to/minimal.ini`
* to really upload files: `php -f xtbackup.php ini[]=/path_to/s3access.ini ini[]=/path_to/minimal.ini storage.s3.update=true`

Configuration
-------------

### Quick

* run: `xtbackup.php --init > myconfig.ini`
* edit myconfig.ini
* run: `xtbackup.php ini[]=myconfig.ini`

### Configuration explained

`xtbackup` is build as library which may be included into different programs.
The controll programm `xtbackup.php` is provided to make backup task functionality available and it makes it possible to execute backup tasks.

`xtbackup.php` by itself interprets following command line options:

* --help : will output basic information how to use the programm
* --init : generate documented INI skeleton
* --quite-start : it is possible to suppress output to console in start phase of engine

All other command line parameters passed to `xtbackup.php` are forwarded to `xtbackup engine` as configuration options.

Most of configuration is done in INI file(s), but command line passed options have precedence over INI definitions.
Special case is the `ini[]` options which can't be used in INI files.
It is possible to define multiple `ini[]` options on command line, they precedence is given in order they are listed.
The purpose of multiple `ini[]` options and precedence of command line options over INI is:
* sharing of configuration
* security, credentials may be stored in private INI files

To start with backup follow:

* run: `xtbackup.php --init > myconfig.ini`
* edit myconfig.ini
* run: `xtbackup.php ini[]=myconfig.ini`

### Configuration reference

Read output of `xtbackup.php --init`, that is all we have and yes, you are welcome to contribute with more and better documentation.
